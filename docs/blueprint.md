# **App Name**: Likas Bayani

## Core Features:

- Sign Up & Wallet Setup: Register through email, social accounts, or national ID integration. Set up a secure wallet compatible with $CARE tokens and NFTs. Personalize your profile with interests (e.g., marine protection, reforestation, urban greening).
- Immersive Onboarding & Education: View a cinematic intro summarizing the Philippines’ environmental crisis. Receive a “Digital Bayani Kit” with a passport, quest checklist, and beginner tools. Engage with a modular Learning Hub on climate, conservation, Web3, and local culture.
- Community & Social Ecosystem: Join regional chat groups and thematic clubs. Get matched with a local mentor or “Quest Marshal.” Earn early badges and digital affiliations (e.g., Mangrove Defender, Coral Steward).
- Interactive Eco-Map Exploration: Browse a live map filled with environmental Quests categorized by impact and urgency. Filter by region, activity type, skill level, partner NGO, and ecological need. Review each Quest’s details, including difficulty, impact rating, and testimonials.
- Smart Matching & Scheduling: AI recommends Quests based on your skillset and travel plans. Add activities to your “Impact Calendar.” Coordinate with friends or organize joint events via the platform.
- Prepare & Navigate: Access gear checklists, AR trail maps, and safety info. Receive step-by-step guides from Quest partners.
- Complete the Mission: Take real-world action—plant, clean, document, teach, or survey. Capture geo-tagged evidence with photos, videos, and environmental stats. Data is automatically recorded with GPS and timestamp verification.
- Submission & Feedback: Upload your Impact Package for review. Receive updates on quest status: Pending, Verified, or Rejected. Get endorsements from peers and quest partners.
- Three-Tier Verification System: Validates GPS, timestamp, and data consistency. Partner NGOs or LGUs approve complex quests. Staked users review and validate simple quests.
- Integrity & Governance: Verifiers must stake $CARE to review. Fraudulent approvals result in “slashing”—a partial token loss. Submissions can be challenged; successful challengers earn token rewards.
- Rewards & Proof of Action: Verified quests trigger automatic token rewards. Unique, non-transferable NFTs (“Proof-of-Action”) are minted for each contribution. Leaderboards and community highlights celebrate top contributors.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color Palette for Gamified Ecotourism Platform: Earthy tones (greens, browns, blues) with vibrant accents (yellows, oranges) to represent nature and rewards.
- Font Choices: Use a clear, modern font (e.g., Open Sans, Lato) for readability and a stylized font (e.g., Montserrat, Raleway) for headings and emphasis.
- Icon Set: Consistent, thematic icons representing different quests, achievements, and environmental elements.
- Information Hierarchy: Prioritize key information (quest details, rewards, progress) with clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Microinteractions: Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement and provide feedback (e.g., quest completion, reward notifications).
